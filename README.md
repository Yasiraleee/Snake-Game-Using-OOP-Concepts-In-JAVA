# Snake-Game-Using-OOP-Concepts-In-JAVA


This is a Java.swing-based snake game that I made for my OOP project.
This project uses OOP concepts and includes a number of displays, including the Homescreen, the Highscore, the Login, the Actual Game, and Help.

Additionally, filing is completed in highscores and login.

I created the background using Google Images.

The programme enables users to play the game, view high scores, log in, and enjoy themselves.
